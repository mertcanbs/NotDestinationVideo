# NotDestinationVideo
A video player built for visionOS based on Apple's Destination Video sample, except the video metadata are served from AWS DynamoDB, and images are served from AWS S3.

An extra video "A Day At Griffith Observatory" was added on top of Apple's samples. This video was taken from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubU51qRSDLY)

Please see Apple's Destination Video sample [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/destination-video).
